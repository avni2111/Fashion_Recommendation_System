## Project Overview
The Fashion Recommendation System is an AI-powered application designed to suggest visually similar fashion products based on an uploaded image. It utilizes **deep learning and machine learning techniques** to extract image features and recommend matching products from a **dataset of approximately 44,000 images**.  

By leveraging computer vision, this system helps users find fashion items that resemble their uploaded image, making it highly useful for **e-commerce platforms, fashion retailers, and personal styling applications**.  

## Key Features  
- Image Feature Extraction: Uses a deep learning model to analyze fashion images and extract unique feature representations.  
 -Similarity Matching: Implements an efficient nearest neighbor search algorithm to compare images based on extracted features.  
- Interactive Web Interface: Provides an easy-to-use **Streamlit-based UI** where users can upload an image and receive recommendations.  
- Large-Scale Dataset: Processes a **diverse collection of 44,000 fashion images** for robust and accurate recommendations.  

## Project Architecture  
The system is structured into three main Python scripts, each responsible for different aspects of the project:  

### 1️⃣ Data Processing & Feature Extraction  
- Loads a pre-trained deep learning model (ResNet50)** to extract numerical representations (feature vectors) from fashion images.  
- Iterates through 44,000 images to compute feature embeddings.  
- Stores the extracted features and corresponding image file paths for quick retrieval.  

 2️⃣ Web Application (User Interaction)  
- Users upload an image through a **Streamlit-based web interface**.  
- The system extracts features from the uploaded image and compares them with the precomputed dataset.  
- It retrieves and displays the **top 5 visually similar fashion products**.  

 3️⃣ Offline Testing & Model Validation  
- Runs tests with sample images to verify the recommendation accuracy.  
- Uses **computer vision techniques** to display the recommended images for validation.  

## Technology Stack  
- Deep Learning Model: ResNet50 (Pre-trained on ImageNet)  
- Programming Language: Python  
- Frontend: Streamlit  
- Backend & Image Processing: TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy  
- Machine Learning Algorithm: Nearest Neighbors (Euclidean Distance)  
- Data Storage: Pickle  

 How It Works?  
1️⃣ Dataset Processing: The system pre-processes **44,000 fashion images** and extracts deep-learning-based feature vectors.  
2️⃣ Feature Storage: The extracted features are stored for efficient comparison.  
3️⃣ User Uploads an Image: The system extracts features from the uploaded image.  
4️⃣ Similarity Matching: Uses a **nearest neighbor search algorithm** to find visually similar images.  
5️⃣ Recommendation Output: Displays **five fashion product recommendations** based on similarity.  

## Future Enhancements  
 **Enhancing the model** with more advanced deep learning architectures for better accuracy.  
 **Adding category filters** (e.g., dresses, shoes, accessories) to refine recommendations.  
 **Deploying as a full-stack application with a proper backend database.  
 **Optimizing performance** using FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for large-scale datasets.
